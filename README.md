# javascript-animated-navbar

[link to tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc8NB2JyxE)

In past, we used to use the scrool event to make the animated navbar, but after seeing this tutorial in which the intersection observer is used in javascript to create this effect. So i tried to follow the tutorial and created the beautiful scrool effect with animation. I will use this in future with other project.
